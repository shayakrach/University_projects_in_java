## COVID-19-Vaccination-Queue

I simulated the future vaccination process for the COVID-19 infection.  
In this project I implemented the Person and CoronaQueue classes.  
The Person class represents a subject, waiting in line to get the vaccine.  
The CoronaQueue class is the data structure itself.  


## Sorting

I wrote Java implementation of several algorithms studied in the class:
- Heap Sort
- Build Heap
- Quick sort (with an arbitrary pivot)
- Merge Sort
- Bubble Sort

This also come with a graph that shows the 
differences runtime between each sorting.
