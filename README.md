## COVID-19-Vaccination-Queue

I simulated the future vaccination process for the COVID-19 infection.  
In this project I implemented the Person and CoronaQueue classes.  
The Person class represents a subject, waiting in line to get the vaccine.  
The CoronaQueue class is the data structure itself.  


## Sorting

I wrote Java implementation of several algorithms studied in the class:
- Heap Sort
- Build Heap
- Quick sort (with an arbitrary pivot)
- Merge Sort
- Bubble Sort

This also come with a graph that shows the differences runtime between each sorting.


## COVID-19-vaccination-keep-records

Implement the data structure in the following way:  
The subjects (represented by the supplied Person class from the first project)  
will be held in 2 AVL trees, ordered according to their ID numbers.  
The first tree stores subjects that await termination while the second tree stores all the vaccinated subjects.  
In this project I also implemented AVLNode, AVLTree and VaccinationRecord classes.
