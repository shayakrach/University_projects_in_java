## COVID-19-Vaccination-Queue

I simulated the future vaccination process for the COVID-19 infection.  
In this project I implemented the Person and CoronaQueue classes.  
The Person class represents a subject, waiting in line to get the vaccine.  
The CoronaQueue class is the data structure itself.
